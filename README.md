# qPCR-analysis
Takes excel file output from qPCR and plots CT curve and Tms in publication format

Coding this trivial analysis and plotting is especially relevant because I run tons of qPCR and I want all the plots to have the same formatting for easy comparision of data between runs. I wouldn't want to plot all these on excel!

Git organization

1. Each branch of this repo is the code run on a file named after the experiment (ex: S024) with the desired plotting formats and extra items
2. There are different master branches for each of the major tasks the experiments fall under a. Time_series_master (ex: S019) b. master (ex: S024) (for generic qPCR) C. Dose_response (ex: S03)
