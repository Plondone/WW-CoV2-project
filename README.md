# qPCR-analysis
Takes excel file output from qPCR and plots CT curve and Tms in publication format

Coding this trivial analysis and plotting is especially relevant because I run tons of qPCR and I want all the plots to have the same formatting for easy comparision of data between runs. I wouldn't want to plot all these on excel!
